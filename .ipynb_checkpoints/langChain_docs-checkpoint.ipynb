As for its valuation ratios, they are all significantly lower than the \\nsector average. Although this can indicate a somewhat cheap stock, all the ratios are very much \\nin line with the equipment industry average  (Medtronic) . With so many drug and equipment \\ncompanies continuously creating products, there is need for a distribution ind ustry.  \\n \\nDistribution  \\n        Distribution in an essential part of the healthcare sector supply chain. It represents all \\ndistributors and wholesalers of health care products. This can include companies anywhere from \\npharmacies to wholesalers of equipment. With more and more drugs and equipment being \\nproduced, the distribution industry is quickly growing. For example AmerisourceBergen, one of \\nAmericaâ€™s largest distribution companies, has had a 485% increase in stock  price over the last \\nfive years  (Amerisourc eBergen Corp) . With a successful distribution industry, drug and \\nequipment companies are able to effectively get their products to hospitals and other health care \\nfacilities.  \\n \\nFacilities  \\nHealthcare facilities are  the health care provider s in the healthcare  sector. It it where medicines \\nare delivered to needing  patient s and where doctors practice medicine. In this sub -industry , \\ncompanies provide a wide range of health care and social services through hospitals, doctors' \\noffices, nursing homes, outpatient surgery centers, and other facilities. In  the last two years, the \\nindustry growth is lower than the average healthcare sector growth. The healthcare facilities \\nindustry is under great pressure of revenue growth. The hospital industry has  a combined \\nrevenue  of $ 700 billion per  year, but the top 50 organizations generate less than 30 percent of \\nrevenue  (first research inc.) . Cost is relatively high  in this industry  because hospital s need \\nexpensive equipment such  CT and MRI machine s in order to operate. Anoth er cost factor is the \\nlabor cost,  sometime s making  up as high as 40% of total revenue. The current trend for th e \\nindustry is merging  with competing facilities or even health insurance companies in order to \\nprovide more cost -effective care.  \\n \\n \\nManaged Healt h Care  \\nThe managed h ealth care sub -industry is described as a variety of techniques intended to reduce \\nthe cost of providing health benefits and improve the quality of care , in other words  it is the \\nhealth insurance industry. Compare d with other sub-industries  within the healthcare sector, \\nmanaged health care has a higher rate of growth. As the  health care act reform requires that  \\neveryone be insured, it is a great opportunity for insurance companies.\", metadata={'source': 'sample_pdf.pdf', 'page': 2})"
